## Key Features

### 1. **Overview Page**
The **Overview Page** provides a bird’s-eye view of customer retention metrics. It includes key performance indicators (KPIs), churn trends, and insights into customer segments.

- **KPIs (Key Performance Indicators)**:
    - **Overall Churn Rate**: The percentage of all customers who have churned.
    - **High-Value Churn Rate**: The percentage of high-value customers (those with the highest revenue potential) who have churned.
    - **Total Revenue Lost**: The total revenue that has been lost due to customers churning.
    - **Customers at Risk**: The number of high-risk customers who are likely to churn soon.
    - **Active Customers**: The current number of active customers.
    - **Average CLV**: The average customer lifetime value (CLV), a measure of how much revenue each customer is expected to generate.

- **Churn Trends**: A line graph that shows how churn changes based on customer tenure (how long they’ve been with the company). This helps you identify if customers are leaving early in their contracts or after a certain period.

- **Churn by Customer Segment**: A bar chart that breaks down churn by customer demographics such as age, gender, contract type, or internet service type.

### 2. **Churn Analysis Page**
The **Churn Analysis Page** provides deeper insights into why customers are leaving the company. It analyzes customer feedback and categorizes churn reasons.

- **Customers Lost by Churn Reason**: This section highlights the most common reasons customers gave for leaving the company (e.g., pricing, dissatisfaction with service, competition).

- **Revenue Loss by Churn Category**: This bar chart shows how much revenue was lost due to each churn reason, helping you understand the financial impact of different customer concerns.

This page can be used to identify areas where improvements should be prioritized, whether that's improving customer service, offering better pricing, or addressing technical issues.

### 3. **High-Value Customers at Risk Page**
The **High-Value Customers at Risk Page** focuses on customers who generate significant revenue and are at high risk of churning. Retaining these customers is critical to maintaining profitability.

- **High-Value Customers at Risk**: This KPI shows the total number of high-value customers (based on lifetime value) who are currently at risk of leaving.

- **Estimated Revenue at Risk**: The total potential revenue that could be lost if these high-value customers churn.

- **CLV Distribution**: A visual representation of the distribution of Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) among high-value customers, which helps identify how much revenue is concentrated among a few top customers.

- **Top 10 High-Value Customers**: A table showing the top 10 customers who are most at risk, along with details like tenure, monthly charges, and contract type.

- **Customer Exploration**: Users can click on individual high-value customers to see detailed information about their account, risks, and potential reasons for churn. This is especially useful for account managers who want to take immediate action to retain a specific customer.

### 4. **Customer Segmentation Page**
The **Customer Segmentation Page** allows you to segment customers based on risk, contract type, internet service type, and other characteristics. This helps you identify trends within specific groups of customers and tailor your retention strategies accordingly.

- **Risk Group Segmentation**: This pie chart shows how customers are distributed across different risk levels (e.g., high, medium, or low). It helps you understand how many customers are at risk and how they are spread across the different risk categories.

- **Contract Type and Internet Type Breakdown**: Separate visualizations show how customers are segmented by their contract type (e.g., month-to-month or yearly contracts) and internet service type (e.g., DSL, fiber optic). This information helps identify which customer segments are most vulnerable to churn.

- **Geographical Churn Map**: A geographic map visualizes where churn is occurring based on customer location (e.g., city or ZIP code). This helps you spot regional patterns of churn and determine whether certain areas are more likely to lose customers.

- **Customer Segments Overview**: A table that summarizes key customer data, including the number of customers, average monthly charges, CLV, and average tenure for each segment (e.g., by contract or internet type). This allows you to compare the characteristics of different segments at a glance.

### 5. **Retention Strategies Page**
The **Retention Strategies Page** provides actionable recommendations for retaining customers who are at risk of churning.

- **Customer Information**: After selecting a customer, you can see detailed information about their account, such as tenure, monthly charges, contract type, and risk levels.
